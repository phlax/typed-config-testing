Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n   breaking changes.)\n\n Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official\n protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\n type.googleapis.com.\n\n Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\n used with implementation specific semantics."

The name should be in a canonical form\n (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\n In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\n expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\n scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\n server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n   value in binary format, or produce an error.\n * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n   breaking changes.)\n\n Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official\n protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\n type.googleapis.com.\n\n Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\n used with implementation specific semantics."

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n   breaking changes.)\n\n Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official\n protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\n type.googleapis.com.\n\n Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\n used with implementation specific semantics."
